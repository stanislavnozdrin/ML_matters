# ML_matters
The repository is devoted to attemption to systemize my knowledge about ml methods, statics, preproccesing data and e.t.c.

It includes a mathematics base of ml methods with detailed discription. 

<b> It will include: </b>
- Items devoted to preprocessing of data, missing values, types of values and e.t.c
- Shuffle, sampling, standartization, pipeline transformations 
- Linear Regression + Polynomial features and regularization(It has already existed)
- Logistic Regression 
- SVM
- Tree and Random Forest
- Boosting models 
- Classification & Regression metrics and e.t.c.
- Prediction of time series
- Neural networks(PyTorch and TensorFlow)
